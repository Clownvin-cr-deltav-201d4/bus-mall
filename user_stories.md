<h1>User Stores</h1>

<ul>
  <li>As a busmall owner, I want to make sure that each set of images contains no duplicates, so that
  the user isn't potentially presented with two or three of the same option, devaluing that vote phase.</li>
  <li>As a busmall shopper, I want to make sure that each image is formatted the same, so that
  it's easier to digest the information on the screen</li>
  <li>As a busmall owner, I want the program to display a graph or something to show which options the users clicked the most, that way I can provide them with the products they want, and remove unwanted products from the rotation</li>
  <li>As a busmall developer, I want a sort of API to rapidly develop new "product" elements, that way I can spend more time
  focusing on the actual "meat" of the application</li>
  <li>As a busmall shopper, I want app to stop giving me options after awhile (25), that way I don't consume my whole day selecting products because I'm an aggressive consumer who wants everything</li>
</ul>
